The Reichenbach Fall

ELLA: Why today? 
JOHN: D’you want to hear me say it? 
ELLA: Eighteen months since our last appointment. 
JOHN: D’you read the papers? 
ELLA: Sometimes. 
JOHN: Mmm, and you watch telly? You know why I’m here. I’m here because ... 
ELLA: What happened, John? 
JOHN: Sher... 
ELLA: You need to get it out. 
JOHN: My best friend ... Sherlock Holmes ... is dead. 

GALLERY DIRECTOR: Falls of the Reichenbach, Turner’s masterpiece, thankfully recovered owing to the prodigious talent of Mr. Sherlock Holmes. A small token of our gratitude. 
SHERLOCK: Diamond cufflinks. All my cuffs have buttons. 
JOHN: He means thank you. 
SHERLOCK: Do I? 
JOHN: Just say it. 
SHERLOCK: Thank you. 
JOHN: Hey. 

FATHER: Back together with my family after my terrifying ordeal; and we have one person to thank for my deliverance – Sherlock Holmes. 
SHERLOCK: Tie pin. I don’t wear ties. 
JOHN: Shh. 

LESTRADE: Peter Ricoletti: number one on Interpol’s Most Wanted list since 1982. But we got him; and there’s one person we have to thank for giving us the decisive leads ... with all his customary diplomacy and tact(!) 
JOHN: Sarcasm. 
SHERLOCK: Yes. 
LESTRADE: We all chipped in. 
SHERLOCK: Oh! 
FIRST REPORTER: Put the hat on! 
SECOND REPORTER: Put the hat on! 
LESTRADE: Yeah, Sherlock, put it on! 
JOHN: Just get it over with. 

SHERLOCK: “Boffin.” “Boffin Sherlock Holmes.” 
JOHN: Everybody gets one. 
SHERLOCK: One what? 
JOHN: Tabloid nickname: ‘SuBo’; ‘Nasty Nick.’ Shouldn’t worry – I’ll probably get one soon. 
SHERLOCK: Page five, column six, first sentence. Why is it always the hat photograph? 
JOHN: “Bachelor John Watson”? 
SHERLOCK: What sort of hat is it anyway? 
JOHN: “Bachelor”? What the hell are they implying? 
SHERLOCK: Is it a cap? Why has it got two fronts? 
JOHN: It’s a deerstalker. “Frequently seen in the company of bachelor John Watson ...” 
SHERLOCK: You stalk a deer with a hat? What are you gonna do – throw it? 
JOHN: “... confirmed bachelor John Watson”! 
SHERLOCK: Some sort of death frisbee? 
JOHN: Okay, this is too much. We need to be more careful. 
SHERLOCK: It’s got flaps ... ear flaps. It’s an ear hat, John. What do you mean, “more careful”? 
JOHN: I mean this isn’t a deerstalker now; it’s a Sherlock Holmes hat. I mean that you’re not exactly a private detective any more. You’re this far from famous. 
SHERLOCK: Oh, it’ll pass. 
JOHN: It’d better pass. The press will turn, Sherlock. They always turn, and they’ll turn on you. 
SHERLOCK: It really bothers you. 
JOHN: What? 
SHERLOCK: What people say. 
JOHN: Yes. 
SHERLOCK: About me? I don’t understand – why would it upset you? 
JOHN: Just try to keep a low profile. Find yourself a little case this week. Stay out of the news. 

JOHN: It’s your phone. 
SHERLOCK: Mm. Keeps doing that. 
JOHN: So, did you just talk to him for a really long time? 
SHERLOCK: Oh. Henry Fishgard never committed suicide. Bow Street Runners: missed everything. 
JOHN: Pressing case, is it?(!) 
SHERLOCK: They’re all pressing ’til they’re solved. 

SECURITY MAN: Put this in your bag, please. Excuse me, sir. Any metal objects – keys, mobile phones? You can go through. Thank you. 
SURVEILLANCE MAN 1: Fancy a cuppa, then, mate? 
SURVEILLANCE MAN 2: Yeah, why not? 

BANK DIRECTOR: Gilts at seven; Dutch telecoms in freefall. Thank you, Harvey. 

PRISON GOVERNOR: What do you say: refuse them all parole and bring back the rope(!) Let’s begin. 

VOICE: This is an emergency. Please leave the building. 
SECURITY GUARD: Sir, I’m gonna have to ask you to leave. 

DONOVAN: Sir, there’s been a break-in. 
LESTRADE: Not our division. 
DONOVAN: You’ll want it. 

BANK DIRECTOR: The vault! 

LESTRADE: Hacked into the Tower of bloody London security?! How?! Tell them we’re already on our way. 
DONOVAN: There’s been another one; another break-in. Bank of England! 

PRISON WARDER: Sir, security’s down, sir. It’s failing! 

LESTRADE: What is it now? 
DONOVAN: Pentonville Prison! 
LESTRADE: Oh no! 

JIM: No rush. 

JOHN: I’ll get it, shall I? Here. 
SHERLOCK: Not now, I’m busy. 
JOHN: Sherlock ... 
SHERLOCK: Not now. 
JOHN: He’s back. 

LESTRADE: That glass is tougher than anything. 
SHERLOCK: Not tougher than crystallised carbon. He used a diamond. 

JOHN: Ready? 
SHERLOCK: Yes. 
JOHN: Get in. Remember ... 
SHERLOCK: Yes. 
JOHN: Remember ... 
SHERLOCK: Yes. 
JOHN: Remember what they told you: don’t try to be clever ... 
SHERLOCK: No. 
JOHN: ... and please, just keep it simple and brief. 
SHERLOCK: God forbid the star witness at the trial should come across as intelligent. 
JOHN: ‘Intelligent,’ fine; let’s give ‘smart-arse’ a wide berth. 
SHERLOCK: I’ll just be myself. 
JOHN: Are you listening to me?! 

ITN REPORTER: ... here today standing outside ... 
SKY NEWS REPORTER: ... This is the trial of the century ... 
BBC NEWS REPORTER: ... the trial of James Moriarty ... 
SKY NEWS REPORTER: ... James Moriarty, earlier today accused of attempt... 
ITN REPORTER: ... of attempting to steal the Crown Jewels ... 
BBC NEWS REPORTER: ... at the Old Bailey we have Reichenbach Hero Sherlock Holmes ... 
JIM: Would you mind slipping your hand into my pocket? Thanks. 

TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT: Crown versus Moriarty – please proceed to Court Ten. 
KITTY: You’re him. 
SHERLOCK: Wrong toilet. 
KITTY: I’m a big fan. 
SHERLOCK: Evidently. 
KITTY: I read your cases; follow them all. Sign my shirt, would you? 
SHERLOCK: There are two types of fans. 
KITTY: Oh? 
SHERLOCK: “Catch me before I kill again” – Type A ... 
KITTY: Uh-huh. What’s Type B? 
SHERLOCK: “Your bedroom’s just a taxi ride away.” 
KITTY: Guess which one I am. 
SHERLOCK: Neither. 
KITTY: Really? 
SHERLOCK: No. You’re not a fan at all. Those marks on your forearm: edge of a desk. You’ve been typing in a hurry, probably. Pressure on; facing a deadline. 
KITTY: That all? 
SHERLOCK: And there’s a smudge of ink on your wrist; and a bulge in your left jacket pocket. 
KITTY: Bit of a giveaway. 
SHERLOCK: The smudge is deliberate, to see if I’m as good as they say I am. Hmm. Oil-based, used in newspaper print, but drawn on with an index finger; your finger. 
KITTY: Hmm! 
SHERLOCK: Journalist. Unlikely you’d get your hands dirty at the press. You put that there to test me. 
KITTY: Wow, I’m liking you! 
SHERLOCK: You mean I’d make a great feature: “Sherlock Holmes – the man beneath the hat.” 
KITTY: Kitty ... Riley. Pleased to meet you. 
SHERLOCK: No. I’m just saving you the trouble of asking. No, I won’t give you an interview; no, I don’t want the money. 
KITTY: You and John Watson – just platonic? Can I put you down for a “no” there, as well? There’s all sorts of gossip in the press about you. Sooner or later you’re gonna need someone on your side ... someone to set the record straight. 
SHERLOCK: And you think you’re the girl for that job, do you? 
KITTY: I’m smart, and you can trust me, totally. 
SHERLOCK: Smart, okay: investigative journalist. Good. Well, look at me and tell me what you see. If you’re that skilful, you don’t need an interview. You can just read what you need. No? Okay, my turn. I look at you and I see someone who’s still waiting for their first big scoop so that their editor will notice them. You’re wearing an expensive skirt but it’s been re-hemmed twice; only posh skirt you’ve got. And your nails: you can’t afford to do them that often. I see someone who’s hungry. I don’t see smart, and I definitely don’t see trustworthy, but I’ll give you a quote if you like – three little words. You ... repel ... me. 

PROSECUTING BARRISTER: A “consulting criminal.” 
SHERLOCK: Yes. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER: Your words. Can you expand on that answer? 
SHERLOCK: James Moriarty is for hire. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER: A tradesman? 
SHERLOCK: Yes. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER: But not the sort who’d fix your heating. 
SHERLOCK: No, the sort who’d plant a bomb or stage an assassination, but I’m sure he’d make a pretty decent job of your boiler. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER: Would you describe him as ... 
SHERLOCK: Leading. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER: What? 
SHERLOCK: Can’t do that. You’re leading the witness. He’ll object and the judge will uphold. 
JUDGE: Mr Holmes. 
SHERLOCK: Ask me how. How would I describe him? What opinion have I formed of him? Do they not teach you this? 
JUDGE: Mr Holmes, we’re fine without your help. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER: How would you describe this man – his character? 
SHERLOCK: First mistake. James Moriarty isn’t a man at all – he’s a spider; a spider at the centre of a web – a criminal web with a thousand threads and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER: And how long ... 
SHERLOCK: No, no, don’t-don’t do that. That’s really not a good question. 
JUDGE: Mr Holmes. 
SHERLOCK: How long have I known him? Not really your best line of enquiry. We met twice, five minutes in total. I pulled a gun; he tried to blow me up. I felt we had a special something. 
JUDGE: Miss Sorrel, are you seriously claiming this man is an expert, after knowing the accused for just five minutes? 
SHERLOCK: Two minutes would have made me an expert. Five was ample. 
JUDGE: Mr Holmes, that’s a matter for the jury. 
SHERLOCK: Oh, really? One librarian; two teachers; two high-pressured jobs, probably the City. The foreman’s a medical secretary, trained abroad judging by her shorthand. 
JUDGE: Mr Holmes! 
SHERLOCK: Seven are married and two are having an affair – with each other, it would seem! Oh, and they’ve just had tea and biscuits. Would you like to know who ate the wafer? 
JUDGE: Mr Holmes. You’ve been called here to answer Miss Sorrel’s questions, not to give us a display of your intellectual prowess. Keep your answers brief and to the point. Anything else will be treated as contempt. Do you think you could survive for just a few minutes without showing off? 

JOHN: What did I say? I said, “Don’t get clever.” 
SHERLOCK: I can’t just turn it on and off like a tap. Well? 
JOHN: Well what? 
SHERLOCK: You were there for the whole thing, up in the gallery, start to finish. 
JOHN: Like you said it would be. He sat on his backside, never even stirred. 
SHERLOCK: Moriarty’s not mounting any defence. 

JOHN: Bank of England, Tower of London, Pentonville. Three of the most secure places in the country and six weeks ago Moriarty breaks in, no-one knows how or why. All we know is ... 
SHERLOCK: ... he ended up in custody. 
JOHN: Don’t do that. 
SHERLOCK: Do what? 
JOHN: The look. 
SHERLOCK: Look? 
JOHN: You’re doing the look again. 
SHERLOCK: Well, I can’t see it, can I? It’s my face. 
JOHN: Yes, and it’s doing a thing. You’re doing a “we both know what’s really going on here” face. 
SHERLOCK: Well, we do. 
JOHN: No. I don’t, which is why I find The Face so annoying. 
SHERLOCK: If Moriarty wanted the Jewels, he’d have them. If he wanted those prisoners free, they’d be out on the streets. The only reason he’s still in a prison cell right now is because he chose to be there. Somehow this is part of his scheme. 

JUDGE: Mr Crayhill, can we have your first witness? 
DEFENDING BARRISTER: Your Honour, we’re not calling any witnesses. 
JUDGE: I don’t follow. You’ve entered a plea of Not Guilty. 
DEFENDING BARRISTER: Nevertheless, my client is offering no evidence. The defence rests. 

SHERLOCK/JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. James Moriarty stands accused of several counts of attempted burglary, crimes which – if he’s found guilty – will elicit a very long custodial sentence; and yet his legal team has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever to support their plea. I find myself in the unusual position of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly. You must find him guilty. 
SHERLOCK: Guilty. 
JUDGE: You must find him guilty. 

CLERK: They’re coming back. 
JOHN: That’s six minutes. 
CLERK: Surprised it took them that long, to be honest. There’s a queue for the loo. Have you reached a verdict on which you all agree? 

JOHN: Not Guilty. They found him Not Guilty. No defence, and Moriarty’s walked free. Sherlock. Are you listening? He’s out. You-you know he’ll be coming after you. Sher... 

SHERLOCK: Most people knock. But then you’re not most people, I suppose. Kettle’s just boiled. 
JIM: Johann Sebastian would be appalled. May I? 
SHERLOCK: Please. 
JIM: You know when he was on his death bed, Bach, he heard his son at the piano playing one of his pieces. The boy stopped before he got to the end ... 
SHERLOCK: ... and the dying man jumped out of his bed, ran straight to the piano and finished it. 
JIM: Couldn’t cope with an unfinished melody. 
SHERLOCK: Neither can you. That’s why you’ve come. 
JIM: But be honest: you’re just a tiny bit pleased. 
SHERLOCK: What, with the verdict? 
JIM: With me ... back on the streets. Every fairytale needs a good old-fashioned villain. You need me, or you’re nothing. Because we’re just alike, you and I – except you’re boring. You’re on the side of the angels. 
SHERLOCK: Got to the jury, of course. 
JIM: I got into the Tower of London; you think I can’t worm my way into twelve hotel rooms? 
SHERLOCK: Cable network. 
JIM: Every hotel bedroom has a personalised TV screen ... and every person has their pressure point; someone that they want to protect from harm. Easy-peasy. 
SHERLOCK: So how’re you going to do it ... burn me? 
JIM: Oh, that’s the problem – the final problem. Have you worked out what it is yet? What’s the final problem? I did tell you ... but did you listen? How hard do you find it, having to say “I don’t know”? 
SHERLOCK: I dunno. 
JIM: Oh, that’s clever; that’s very clever; awfully clever. Speaking of clever, have you told your little friends yet? 
SHERLOCK: Told them what? 
JIM: Why I broke into all those places and never took anything. 
SHERLOCK: No. 
JIM: But you understand. 
SHERLOCK: Obviously. 
JIM: Off you go, then. 
SHERLOCK: You want me to tell you what you already know? 
JIM: No; I want you to prove that you know it. 
SHERLOCK: You didn’t take anything because you don’t need to. 
JIM: Good. 
SHERLOCK: You’ll never need to take anything ever again. 
JIM: Very good. Because ...? 
SHERLOCK: Because nothing ... nothing in the Bank of England, the Tower of London or Pentonville Prison could possibly match the value of the key that could get you into all three. 
JIM: I can open any door anywhere with a few tiny lines of computer code. No such thing as a private bank account now – they’re all mine. No such thing as secrecy – I own secrecy. Nuclear codes – I could blow up NATO in alphabetical order. In a world with locked rooms, the man with the key is king; and honey, you should see me in a crown. 
SHERLOCK: You were advertising all the way through the trial. You were showing the world what you can do. 
JIM: And you were helping. Big client list: rogue governments, intelligence communities ... terrorist cells. They all want me. Suddenly, I’m Mr Sex. 
SHERLOCK: If you could break any bank, what do you care about the highest bidder? 
JIM: I don’t. I just like to watch them all competing. “Daddy loves me the best!” Aren’t ordinary people adorable? Well, you know: you’ve got John. I should get myself a live-in one. 
SHERLOCK: Why are you doing all of this? 
JIM: It’d be so funny. 
SHERLOCK: You don’t want money or power – not really. What is it all for? 
JIM: I want to solve the problem – our problem; the final problem. It’s gonna start very soon, Sherlock: the fall. But don’t be scared. Falling’s just like flying, except there’s a more permanent destination. 
SHERLOCK: Never liked riddles. 
JIM: Learn to. Because I owe you a fall, Sherlock. I ... owe ... you. 

JOHN: Er, excuse me. Um, I’m looking for Mycroft Holmes. Would you happen to know if he’s around at all? Can you not hear me? Yes, all right. Anyone? Anyone at all know where Mycroft Holmes is? I’ve been asked to meet him here. No takers? Right. Am I invisible? Can you actually see me? Ah, thanks, gents. I’ve been asked to meet Mycroft Holm... What the ...? Hey! 

MYCROFT: Tradition, John. Our traditions define us. 
JOHN: So total silence is traditional, is it? You can’t even say, “Pass the sugar.” 
MYCROFT: Three-quarters of the diplomatic service and half the government front bench all sharing one tea trolley. It’s for the best, believe me. They don’t want a repeat of 1972. But we can talk in here. 
JOHN: You read this stuff? 
MYCROFT: Caught my eye. 
JOHN: Mmm-hmm. 
MYCROFT: Saturday: they’re doing a big exposé. 
JOHN: I’d love to know where she got her information. 
MYCROFT: Someone called Brook. Recognise the name? 
JOHN: School friend, maybe? 
MYCROFT: Of Sherlock’s? But that’s not why I asked you here. 
JOHN: Who’s that? 
MYCROFT: Don’t know him? 
JOHN: No. 
MYCROFT: Never seen his face before? 
JOHN: Umm ... 
MYCROFT: He’s taken a flat in Baker Street, two doors down from you. 
JOHN: Hmm! I was thinking of doing a drinks thing for the neighbours. 
MYCROFT: Not sure you’ll want to. Sulejmani. Albanian hit squad. Expertly-trained killer living less than twenty feet from your front door. 
JOHN: It’s a great location. Jubilee line’s handy. 
MYCROFT: John ... 
JOHN: What’s it got to do with me? 
MYCROFT: Dyachenko, Ludmila. 
JOHN: Um, actually, I think I have seen her. 
MYCROFT: Russian killer. She’s taken the flat opposite. 
JOHN: Okay ... I’m sensing a pattern here. 
MYCROFT: In fact, four top international assassins relocate to within spitting distance of two hundred and twenty-one B. Anything you care to share with me? 
JOHN: I’m moving?! 
MYCROFT: It’s not hard to guess the common denominator, is it? 
JOHN: You think this is Moriarty? 
MYCROFT: He promised Sherlock he’d come back. 
JOHN: If this was Moriarty, we’d be dead already. 
MYCROFT: If not Moriarty, then who? 
JOHN: Why don’t you talk to Sherlock if you’re so concerned about him? Oh God, don’t tell me. 
MYCROFT: Too much history between us, John. Old scores; resentments. 
JOHN: Nicked all his Smurfs? Broke his Action Man? Finished. 
MYCROFT: We both know what’s coming, John. Moriarty is obsessed. He’s sworn to destroy his only rival. 
JOHN: So you want me to watch out for your brother because he won’t accept your help. 
MYCROFT: If it’s not too much trouble. 

MAN: ’Scuse, mate. 
JOHN: Oh. Sherlock, something weird ... What’s going on? 
SHERLOCK: Kidnapping. 
LESTRADE: Rufus Bruhl, the ambassador to the U.S. 
JOHN: He’s in Washington, isn’t he? 
LESTRADE: Not him – his children, Max and Claudette, age seven and nine. They’re at St Aldate’s. 
DONOVAN: Posh boarding place down in Surrey. 
LESTRADE: The school broke up; all the other boarders went home – just a few kids remained, including those two. 
DONOVAN: The kids have vanished. 
LESTRADE: The ambassador’s asked for you personally. 
DONOVAN: The Reichenbach Hero. 
LESTRADE: Isn’t it great to be working with a celebrity(!) 

FEMALE POLICE OFFICER: It’s all right. 
LESTRADE: Miss Mackenzie, House Mistress. Go easy. 
SHERLOCK: Miss Mackenzie, you’re in charge of pupil welfare, yet you left this place wide open last night. What are you: an idiot, a drunk or a criminal? Now quickly, tell me! 
MISS MACKENZIE: All the doors and windows were properly bolted. No-one – not even me – went into their room last night. You have to believe me! 
SHERLOCK: I do. I just wanted you to speak quickly. Miss Mackenzie will need to breathe into a bag now. 

JOHN: Six grand a term, you’d expect them to keep the kids safe for you. You said the other kids had all left on their holidays? 
LESTRADE: They were the only two sleeping on this floor. Absolutely no sign of a break-in. The intruder must have been hidden inside some place. 
SHERLOCK: Show me where the brother slept. The boy sleeps there every night, gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor. He’d recognise every shape, every outline, the silhouette of everyone who came to the door. 
LESTRADE: Okay, so ... 
SHERLOCK: So someone approaches the door who he doesn’t recognise, an intruder. Maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon. What would he do in the precious few seconds before they came into the room? How would he use them if not to cry out? This little boy; this particular little boy ... who reads all of those spy books. What would he do? 
JOHN: He’d leave a sign? 
SHERLOCK: Get Anderson. 

SHERLOCK: Linseed oil. 
ANDERSON: Not much use. Doesn’t lead us to the kidnapper. 
SHERLOCK: Brilliant, Anderson. 
ANDERSON: Really? 
SHERLOCK: Yes. Brilliant impression of an idiot. The floor. 
JOHN: He made a trail for us! 
SHERLOCK: The boy was made to walk ahead of them. 
JOHN: On, what, tiptoe? 
SHERLOCK: Indicates anxiety; a gun held to his head. The girl was pulled beside him, dragged sideways. He had his left arm cradled about her neck. 
ANDERSON: That’s the end of it. We don’t know where they went from here. Tells us nothing after all. 
SHERLOCK: You’re right, Anderson – nothing. Except his shoe size, his height, his gait, his walking pace. 
JOHN: Having fun? 
SHERLOCK: Starting to. 
JOHN: Maybe don’t do the smiling. Kidnapped children? 

JOHN: But how did he get past the CCTV? If all the doors were locked ... 
SHERLOCK: He walked in when they weren’t locked. 
JOHN: But a stranger can’t just walk into a school like that. 
SHERLOCK: Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment. Yesterday – end of term, parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff. What’s one more stranger among that lot? He was waiting for them. All he had to do was find a place to hide. 

SHERLOCK: Molly! 
MOLLY: Oh, hello. I’m just going out. 
SHERLOCK: No you’re not. 
MOLLY: I’ve got a lunch date. 
SHERLOCK: Cancel it. You’re having lunch with me. 
MOLLY: What? 
SHERLOCK: Need your help. It’s one of your old boyfriends – we’re trying to track him down. He’s been a bit naughty! 
JOHN: It’s Moriarty? 
SHERLOCK: Course it’s Moriarty. 
MOLLY: Er, Jim actually wasn’t even my boyfriend. We went out three times. I ended it. 
SHERLOCK: Yes, and then he stole the Crown Jewels, broke into the Bank of England and organised a prison break at Pentonville. For the sake of law and order, I suggest you avoid all future attempts at a relationship, Molly. 

SHERLOCK: Oil, John. The oil in the kidnapper’s footprint – it’ll lead us to Moriarty. All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved. The sole of the shoe is like a passport. If we’re lucky we can see everything that he’s been up to. I need that analysis. 
MOLLY: Alkaline. 
SHERLOCK: Thank you, John. 
MOLLY: Molly. 
SHERLOCK: Yes. I ... owe ... you. Glycerol molecule. What are you? 
MOLLY: What did you mean, “I owe you”? You said, “I owe you.” You were muttering it while you were working. 
SHERLOCK: Nothing. Mental note. 
MOLLY: You’re a bit like my dad. He’s dead. No, sorry. 
SHERLOCK: Molly, please don’t feel the need to make conversation. It’s really not your area. 
MOLLY: When he was ... dying, he was always cheerful; he was lovely – except when he thought no-one could see. I saw him once. He looked sad. 
SHERLOCK: Molly ... 
MOLLY: You look sad ... when you think he can’t see you. Are you okay? And don’t just say you are, because I know what that means, looking sad when you think no-one can see you. 
SHERLOCK: But you can see me. 
MOLLY: I don’t count. What I’m trying to say is that, if there’s anything I can do, anything you need, anything at all, you can have me. No, I just mean ... I mean if there’s anything you need ... It’s fine. 
SHERLOCK: What-what-what could I need from you? 
MOLLY: Nothing. I dunno. You could probably say thank you, actually. 
SHERLOCK: ... Thank you. 
MOLLY: I’m just gonna go and get some crisps. Do you want anything? It’s okay, I know you don’t. 
SHERLOCK: Well, actually, maybe I’ll ... 
MOLLY: I know you don’t. 
JOHN: Sherlock. 
SHERLOCK: Hmm? 
JOHN: This envelope that was in her trunk. There’s another one. 
SHERLOCK: What? 
JOHN: On our doorstep. Found it today. Yes, and look at that. Look at that. Exactly the same seal. 
SHERLOCK: Breadcrumbs. 
JOHN: Uh-huh. It was there when I got back. 
SHERLOCK: A little trace of breadcrumbs; hardback copy of fairy tales. Two children led into the forest by a wicked father follow a little trail of breadcrumbs. 
JOHN: That’s “Hansel and Gretel.” What sort of kidnapper leaves clues? 
SHERLOCK: The sort that likes to boast; the sort that thinks it’s all a game. He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me ... 
SHERLOCK/JIM: All fairytales need a good old-fashioned villain. 
SHERLOCK: The fifth substance: it’s part of the tale. The witch’s house. 
JOHN: What? 
SHERLOCK: The glycerol molecule. PGPR! 
JOHN: What’s that? 
SHERLOCK: It’s used in making chocolate. 

LESTRADE: This fax arrived an hour ago. What have you got for us? 
SHERLOCK: Need to find a place in the city where all five of these things intersect. 
LESTRADE: Chalk, asphalt, brick dust, vegetation ... What the hell is this? Chocolate? 
SHERLOCK: I think we’re looking for a disused sweet factory. 
LESTRADE: We need to narrow that down. A sweet factory with asphalt? 
SHERLOCK: No. No-no-no. Too general. Need something more specific. Chalk; chalky clay – that’s a far thinner band of geology. 
LESTRADE: Brick dust? 
SHERLOCK: Building site. Bricks from the 1950s. 
LESTRADE: There’s thousands of building sites in London. 
SHERLOCK: I’ve got people out looking. 
LESTRADE: So have I. 
SHERLOCK: Homeless network – faster than the police. Far more relaxed about taking bribes. John. Rhododendron ponticum. It matches. Addlestone. 
LESTRADE: What? 
SHERLOCK: There’s a mile of disused factories between the river and the park. It matches everything. 
LESTRADE: Right, come on. Come on! 

DONOVAN: You, look over there. Look everywhere. Okay, spread out, please. Spread out. 
LESTRADE: Look in there. Quietly. Quietly. 
SHERLOCK: This was alight moments ago. They’re still here. Sweet wrappers. What’s he been feeding you? Hansel and Gretel. Mercury. 
LESTRADE: What? 
SHERLOCK: The papers: they’re painted with mercury. Lethal. The more of the stuff they ate ... 
JOHN: It was killing them. 
SHERLOCK: But it’s not enough to kill them on its own. Taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them. He didn’t need to be there for the execution. Murder by remote control. He could be a thousand miles away. The hungrier they got, the more they ate ... the faster they died. Neat. 
JOHN: Sherlock. 
DONOVAN: Over here! I’ve got you. Don’t worry. 

DONOVAN: Right, then. The professionals have finished. If the amateurs wanna go in and have their turn ... 
LESTRADE: Now, remember, she’s in shock and she’s just seven years old, so anything you can do to ... 
SHERLOCK: ... not be myself. 
LESTRADE: Yeah. Might be helpful. 
SHERLOCK: Claudette, I ... No-no, I know it’s been hard for you ... Claudette, listen to me ... 
LESTRADE: Out. Get out! 

JOHN: Makes no sense. 
LESTRADE: The kid’s traumatised. Something about Sherlock reminds her of the kidnapper. 
JOHN: So what’s she said? 
DONOVAN: Hasn’t uttered another syllable. 
JOHN: And the boy? 
LESTRADE: No, he’s unconscious; still in intensive care. Well, don’t let it get to you. I always feel like screaming when you walk into a room! In fact, so do most people. Come on. 
DONOVAN: Brilliant work you did, finding those kids from just a footprint. It’s really amazing. 
SHERLOCK: Thank you. 
DONOVAN: Unbelievable. 
JOHN: Ah. You okay? 
SHERLOCK: Thinking. This is my cab. You get the next one. 
JOHN: Why? 
SHERLOCK: You might talk. 

LESTRADE: What the hell is this? Chocolate? 
SHERLOCK: I think we’re looking for a disused sweet factory. 
LESTRADE: Get out! 
LESTRADE: Problem? 

VOICEOVER: This is a stunning evening wear set from us here at London Taxi Shopping. 
SHERLOCK: Can you turn this off, please? 
VOICEOVER: As you can see, the set comprises of a beautiful ... 
SHERLOCK: Can you turn this off ... 
JIM: Hullo. Are you ready for the story? This is the story of Sir Boast-a-lot. 

DONOVAN: The footprint. It’s all he has. A footprint. 
LESTRADE: Yeah, well, you know what he’s like – CSI Baker Street. 
DONOVAN: Well, our boys couldn’t have done it. 
LESTRADE: Well, that’s why we need him. He’s better. 
DONOVAN: That’s one explanation. 
LESTRADE: And what’s the other? 

JIM: Sir Boast-a-lot was the bravest and cleverest knight at the Round Table, but soon the other knights began to grow tired of his stories about how brave he was and how many dragons he’d slain ... And soon they began to wonder ... ‘Are Sir Boast-a-lot’s stories even true?’ 
DONOVAN: Only he could have found that evidence. 
JIM: Oh, no. 
DONOVAN: And then the girl screams her head off when she sees him – a man she has never seen before ... unless she had seen him before. 
LESTRADE: Wh-what’s your point? 
DONOVAN: You know what my point is. You just don’t wanna think about it. 
JIM: So one of the knights went to King Arthur and said ... ‘I don’t believe Sir Boast-a-lot’s stories. He’s just a big old liar who makes things up to make himself look good.’ 
LESTRADE: You’re not seriously suggesting he’s involved, are you? 
ANDERSON: I think we have to entertain the possibility. 
JIM: And then even the King began to wonder ... But that wasn’t the end of Sir Boast-a-lot’s problem. No. That wasn’t the final problem. The End. 
SHERLOCK: Stop the cab! Stop the cab! What was that? What was that? 
JIM: No charge. 
MAN: Look out! 
SHERLOCK: Thank you. 
JOHN: Sherlock! 

JOHN: That ... it’s him. It’s him. Sulejmani or something. Mycroft showed me his file. He’s a big Albanian gangster lives two doors down from us. 
SHERLOCK: He died because I shook his hand. 
JOHN: What d’you mean? 
SHERLOCK: He saved my life but he couldn’t touch me. Why? 

SHERLOCK: Four assassins living right on our doorstep. They didn’t come here to kill me; they have to keep me alive. I’ve got something that all of them want, but if one of them approaches me ... 
JOHN: ... the others kill them before they can get it. 
SHERLOCK: All of the attention is focussed on me. There’s a surveillance web closing in on us right now. 
JOHN: So what have you got that’s so important? 
SHERLOCK: We need to ask about the dusting. 

SHERLOCK: Precise details: in the last week, what’s been cleaned? 
MRS HUDSON: Well, Tuesday I did your lino ... 
SHERLOCK: No, in here, this room. This is where we’ll find it – any break in the dust line. You can put back anything but dust. Dust is eloquent. 
MRS HUDSON: What’s he on about? 
SHERLOCK: Cameras. We’re being watched. 
MRS HUDSON: What? Cameras? Here? I’m in my nightie! 
SHERLOCK: No, Inspector. 
LESTRADE: What? 
SHERLOCK: The answer’s no. 
LESTRADE: But you haven’t heard the question! 
SHERLOCK: You want to take me to the station. Just saving you the trouble of asking. 
LESTRADE: Sherlock ... 
SHERLOCK: The scream? 
LESTRADE: Yeah. 
SHERLOCK: Who was it? Donovan? I bet it was Donovan. Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping? Ah, Moriarty is smart. He planted that doubt in her head; that little nagging sensation. You’re going to have to be strong to resist. You can’t kill an idea, can you? Not once it’s made a home ... there. 
LESTRADE: Will you come? 
SHERLOCK: One photograph – that’s his next move. Moriarty’s game: first the scream, then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning. He wants to destroy me inch by inch. It is a game, Lestrade, and not one I’m willing to play. Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan. They’ll be deciding. 
JOHN: Deciding? 
SHERLOCK: Whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me. 
JOHN: You think? 
SHERLOCK: Standard procedure. 
JOHN: Should have gone with him. People’ll think ... 
SHERLOCK: I don’t care what people think. 
JOHN: You’d care if they thought you were stupid, or wrong. 
SHERLOCK: No, that would just make them stupid or wrong. 
JOHN: Sherlock, I don’t want the world believing you’re ... 
SHERLOCK: That I am what? 
JOHN: A fraud. 
SHERLOCK: You’re worried they’re right. 
JOHN: What? 
SHERLOCK: You’re worried they’re right about me. 
JOHN: No. 
SHERLOCK: That’s why you’re so upset. You can’t even entertain the possibility that they might be right. You’re afraid that you’ve been taken in as well. 
JOHN: No I’m not. 
SHERLOCK: Moriarty is playing with your mind too. Can’t you see what’s going on? 
JOHN: No, I know you’re for real. 
SHERLOCK: A hundred percent? 
JOHN: Well, nobody could fake being such an annoying dick all the time. 

CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT: Sherlock Holmes? 
LESTRADE: Yes, sir. 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT: That bloke that’s been in the press. 
LESTRADE: Mmm-hmm. 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT: I thought he was some sort of private eye. 
LESTRADE: He is. 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT: We’ve been consulting with him – that’s what you’re ... you’re telling me? Not used him on any proper cases, though, have we? 
LESTRADE: Well, one or two. 
ANDERSON: Or twenty or thirty. 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT: What? 
LESTRADE: Look, I’m not the only senior officer who did this. Gregson ... 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT: Shut up! An amateur detective given access to all sorts of classified information, and now he’s a suspect in a case! 
LESTRADE: With all due respect, sir ... 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT: You’re a bloody idiot, Lestrade! Now go and fetch him in right now! Do it. 
LESTRADE: Are you proud of yourselves? 
ANDERSON: Well, what if it’s not just this case? What if he’s done this to us every single time? 

JOHN: So, still got some friends on the Force. It’s Lestrade. Says they’re all coming over here right now, queuing up to slap on the handcuffs: every single officer you ever made feel like a tit, which is a lot of people. 
MRS HUDSON: Oh, sorry, am I interrupting? Some chap delivered a parcel. I forgot. Marked ‘Perishable’ – I had to sign for it. Funny name. German, like the fairytales. 
SHERLOCK: Burnt to a crisp. 
JOHN: What does it mean? 
VOICE: Police! 
MRS HUDSON: I’ll go. 
DONOVAN: Sherlock ... 
LESTRADE: Evening, Mrs Hudson. 
DONOVAN: We need to talk to you! 
MRS HUDSON: Don’t barge in like that! 
JOHN: Have you got a warrant? Have you? 
LESTRADE: Leave it, John. 
MRS HUDSON: Really! Manners! 
LESTRADE: Sherlock Holmes, I’m arresting you on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping. 
JOHN: He’s not resisting. 
SHERLOCK: It’s all right, John. 
JOHN: He’s not resisting. No, it’s not all right. This is ridiculous. 
LESTRADE: Get him downstairs now. 
JOHN: You know you don’t have to do ... 
LESTRADE: Don’t try to interfere, or I shall arrest you too. 
JOHN: You done? 
DONOVAN: Oh, I said it. 
JOHN: Mmm-hmm? 
DONOVAN: First time we met. 
JOHN: Don’t bother. 
DONOVAN: “Solving crimes won’t be enough. One day he’ll cross the line.” Now, ask yourself: what sort of man would kidnap those kids just so he can impress us all by finding them? 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT: Donovan. 
DONOVAN: Sir. 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT: Got our man? 
DONOVAN: Er, yes, sir. 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT: Looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me. Often are, these vigilante types. What are you looking at? 

POLICE OFFICER: Are you all right, sir? 
SHERLOCK: Joining me? 
JOHN: Yeah. Apparently it’s against the law to chin the Chief Superintendant. 
SHERLOCK: Hmm. Bit awkward, this. 
JOHN: Huh. No-one to bail us. 
SHERLOCK: I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape. 
RADIO DISPATCHER: All units to two-seven. 
JOHN: What? 
RADIO DISPATCHER: All units to two ... 
SHERLOCK: Ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees? NOW would be good! 
LESTRADE: Do as he says! 
JOHN: Just-just so you’re aware, the gun is his idea. I’m just a ... you know ... 
SHERLOCK: ... my hostage. 
JOHN: Hostage! Yes, that works – that works(!) So what now? 
SHERLOCK: Doing what Moriarty wants – I’m becoming a fugitive. Run. 
CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT: Get after him, Lestrade! 
SHERLOCK: Take my hand. 
JOHN: Now people will definitely talk. The gun! 
SHERLOCK: Leave it! 
JOHN: Sherlock, wait! We’re going to need to coordinate. 
SHERLOCK: Go to your right. 
JOHN: Huh? 
SHERLOCK: Go to your right. Everybody wants to believe it – that’s what makes it so clever. A lie that’s preferable to the truth. All my brilliant deductions were just a sham. No-one feels inadequate – Sherlock Holmes is just an ordinary man. 
JOHN: What about Mycroft? He could help us. 
SHERLOCK: A big family reconciliation? Now’s not really the moment. 
JOHN: Sher... Sherlock. We’re being followed. I knew we couldn’t outrun the police. 
SHERLOCK: That’s not the police. It’s one of my new neighbours from Baker Street. Let’s see if he can give us some answers. 
JOHN: Where are we going? 
SHERLOCK: We’re going to jump in front of that bus. 
JOHN: What?! 
SHERLOCK: Tell me what you want from me. Tell me. 
ASSASSIN: He left it at your flat. 
SHERLOCK: Who? 
ASSASSIN: Moriarty. 
SHERLOCK: What? 
ASSASSIN: The computer keycode. 
SHERLOCK: Of course. He’s selling it – the programme he used to break into the Tower. He planted it when he came around. It’s a game-changer. It’s a key – it can break into any system and it’s sitting in our flat right now. That’s why he left that message telling everyone where to come. “Get Sherlock.” We need to get back into the flat and search. 
JOHN: CID’ll be camped out. Why plant it on you? 
SHERLOCK: It’s another subtle way of smearing my name. Now I’m best pals with all those criminals. 
JOHN: Yeah, well, have you seen this? A kiss and tell. Some bloke called Rich Brook. Who is he? 

SHERLOCK: Too late to go on the record? 

SHERLOCK: Congratulations. The truth about Sherlock Holmes. The scoop that everybody wanted and you got it. Bravo(!) 
KITTY: I gave you your opportunity. I wanted to be on your side, remember? You turned me down, so ... 
SHERLOCK: And then, behold, someone turns up and spills all the beans. How utterly convenient. Who is Brook? Oh, come on, Kitty. No-one trusts the voice at the end of a telephone. There are all those furtive little meetings in cafés; those sessions in the hotel room where he gabbled into your dictaphone. How do you know that you can trust him? A man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets. What were his credentials? 
JIM: Darling, they didn’t have any ground coffee so I just got normal ... You said that they wouldn’t find me here. You said that I’d be safe here. 
KITTY: You are safe, Richard. I’m a witness. He wouldn’t harm you in front of witnesses. 
JOHN: So that’s your source? Moriarty is Richard Brook?! 
KITTY: Of course he’s Richard Brook. There is no Moriarty. There never has been. 
JOHN: What are you talking about? 
KITTY: Look him up. Rich Brook – an actor Sherlock Holmes hired to be Moriarty. 
JIM: Doctor Watson, I know you’re a good man. Don’t ... don’t h... Don’t hurt me. 
JOHN: No, you are Moriarty! He’s Moriarty! We’ve met, remember? You were gonna blow me up! 
JIM: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. He paid me. I needed the work. I’m an actor. I was out of work. I’m sorry, okay? 
JOHN: Sherlock, you’d better ... explain ... because I am not getting this. 
KITTY: Oh I’ll ... I’ll be doing the explaining – in print. It’s all here – conclusive proof. You invented James Moriarty, your nemesis. 
JOHN: Invented him? 
KITTY: Mmm-hmm. Invented all the crimes, actually – and to cap it all, you made up a master villain. 
JOHN: Oh, don’t be ridiculous! 
KITTY: Ask him. He’s right here! Just ask him. Tell him, Richard. 
JOHN: Look, for God’s sake, this man was on trial! 
KITTY: Yes ... and you paid him; paid him to take the rap. Promised you’d rig the jury. Not exactly a West End role, but I’ll bet the money was good. But not so good he didn’t want to sell his story. 
JIM: I am sorry. I am. I am sorry. 
JOHN: So-so this is the story that you’re gonna publish. The big conclusion of it all: Moriarty’s an actor?! 
JIM: He knows I am. I have proof. I have proof. Show him, Kitty! Show him something! 
JOHN: Yeah, show me something. 
JIM: I’m on TV. I’m on kids’ TV. I’m The Storyteller. I’m ... I’m The Storyteller. It’s on DVD. Just tell him. It’s all coming out now. It’s all over. Just tell them. Just tell them. Tell him! It’s all over now ... NO! Don’t you touch me! Don’t you lay a finger on me! 
SHERLOCK: Stop it. Stop it NOW! 
JIM: Don’t hurt me! 
JOHN: Don’t let him get away! 
KITTY: Leave him alone! 
SHERLOCK: No, no, no. He’ll have back-up. 
KITTY: D’you know what, Sherlock Holmes? I look at you now and I can read you. And you ... repel ... me. 
JOHN: Can he do that? Completely change his identity; make you the criminal? 
SHERLOCK: He’s got my whole life story. That’s what you do when you sell a big lie; you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable. 
JOHN: Your word against his. 
SHERLOCK: He’s been sowing doubt into people’s minds for the last twenty-four hours. There’s only one thing he needs to do to complete his game, and that’s to ... 
JOHN: Sherlock? 
SHERLOCK: Something I need to do. 
JOHN: What? Can I help? 
SHERLOCK: No – on my own. 

SHERLOCK: You’re wrong, you know. You do count. You’ve always counted and I’ve always trusted you. But you were right. I’m not okay. 
MOLLY: Tell me what’s wrong. 
SHERLOCK: Molly, I think I’m going to die. 
MOLLY: What do you need? 
SHERLOCK: If I wasn’t everything that you think I am – everything that I think I am – would you still want to help me? 
MOLLY: What do you need? 
SHERLOCK: You. 

JOHN: She has really done her homework, Miss Riley – things that only someone close to Sherlock could know. 
MYCROFT: Ah. 
JOHN: Have you seen your brother’s address book lately? Two names: yours and mine, and Moriarty didn’t get this stuff from me. 
MYCROFT: John ... 
JOHN: So how does it work, then, your relationship? D’you go out for a coffee now and then, eh, you and Jim? Your own brother, and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac. 
MYCROFT: I never inten... I never dreamt ... 
JOHN: So this ...th-th-this ... is what you were trying to tell me, isn’t it: “Watch his back, ’cause I’ve made a mistake.” How did you meet him? 
MYCROFT: People like him: we know about them; we watch them. But James Moriarty ... the most dangerous criminal mind the world has ever seen, and in his pocket the ultimate weapon: a keycode. A few lines of computer code that could unlock any door. 
JOHN: And you abducted him to try and find the keycode? 
MYCROFT: Interrogated him for weeks. 
JOHN: And? 
MYCROFT: He wouldn’t play along. He just sat there, staring into the darkness. The only thing that made him open up ... I could get him to talk ... just a little, but ... 
JOHN: ... in return you had to offer him Sherlock’s life story. So one big lie – Sherlock’s a fraud – but people will swallow it because the rest of it’s true. Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed, right? And you have given him the perfect ammunition. 
MYCROFT: John ... I’m sorry. 
JOHN: Oh, please ... 
MYCROFT: Tell him, would you? 

JOHN: Got your message. 
SHERLOCK: The computer code is key to this. If we find it, we can use it – beat Moriarty at his own game. 
JOHN: What d’you mean, “use it”? 
SHERLOCK: He used it to create a false identity, so we can use it to break into the records and destroy Richard Brook. 
JOHN: And bring back Jim Moriarty again. 
SHERLOCK: Somewhere in 221B, somewhere – on the day of the verdict – he left it hidden. 
JOHN: Uh-huh. What did he touch? 
SHERLOCK: An apple. Nothing else. 
JOHN: Did he write anything down? 
SHERLOCK: No. 

JOHN: Yeah, speaking. Er, what? What happened? Is she okay? Oh my God. Right, yes, I’m coming. 
SHERLOCK: What is it? 
JOHN: Paramedics. Mrs Hudson – she’s been shot. 
SHERLOCK: What? How? 
JOHN: Well, probably one of the killers you managed to attract ... Jesus. Jesus. She’s dying, Sherlock. Let’s go. 
SHERLOCK: You go. I’m busy. 
JOHN: Busy? 
SHERLOCK: Thinking. I need to think. 
JOHN: You need to ...? Doesn’t she mean anything to you? You once half killed a man because he laid a finger on her. 
SHERLOCK: She’s my landlady. 
JOHN: She’s dying ... You machine. Sod this. Sod this. You stay here if you want, on your own. 
SHERLOCK: Alone is what I have. Alone protects me. 
JOHN: No. Friends protect people. 

JIM: Ah. Here we are at last – you and me, Sherlock, and our problem – the final problem. Stayin’ alive! It’s so boring, isn’t it? It’s just ... staying. All my life I’ve been searching for distractions. You were the best distraction and now I don’t even have you. Because I’ve beaten you. And you know what? In the end it was easy. It was easy. Now I’ve got to go back to playing with the ordinary people. And it turns out you’re ordinary just like all of them. Ah well. Did you almost start to wonder if I was real? Did I nearly get you? 
SHERLOCK: Richard Brook. 
JIM: Nobody seems to get the joke, but you do. 
SHERLOCK: Of course. 
JIM: Attaboy. 
SHERLOCK: Rich Brook in German is Reichen Bach – the case that made my name. 
JIM: Just tryin’ to have some fun. Good. You got that too. 
SHERLOCK: Beats like digits. Every beat is a one; every rest is a zero. Binary code. That’s why all those assassins tried to save my life. It was hidden on me; hidden inside my head – a few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system. 
JIM: I told all my clients: last one to Sherlock is a sissy. 
SHERLOCK: Yes, but now that it’s up here, I can use it to alter all the records. I can kill Rich Brook and bring back Jim Moriarty. 
JIM: No, no, no, no, no, this is too easy. This is too easy. There is no key, DOOFUS! Those digits are meaningless. They’re utterly meaningless. You don’t really think a couple of lines of computer code are gonna crash the world around our ears? I’m disappointed. I’m disappointed in you, ordinary Sherlock. 
SHERLOCK: But the rhythm ... 
JIM: “Partita number one.” Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach. 
SHERLOCK: But then how did ... 
JIM: Then how did I break into the Bank, to the Tower, to the Prison? Daylight robbery. All it takes is some willing participants. I knew you’d fall for it. That’s your weakness – you always want everything to be clever. Now, shall we finish the game? One final act. Glad you chose a tall building – nice way to do it. 
SHERLOCK: Do it? Do – do what? Yes, of course. My suicide. 
JIM: “Genius detective proved to be a fraud.” I read it in the paper, so it must be true. I love newspapers. Fairytales. And pretty Grimm ones too. 

MRS HUDSON: Oh, God, John! You made me jump! 
JOHN: But ... 
MRS HUDSON: Is everything okay now with the police? Has, um, Sherlock sorted it all out? 
JOHN: Oh my God. Taxi! Taxi! No, no, no, no, police! ... Sort of. 
MAN: Oh, thanks, mate – thanks a lot(!) 

SHERLOCK: I can still prove that you created an entirely false identity. 
JIM: Oh, just kill yourself. It’s a lot less effort. Go on. For me. Pleeeeeease? 
SHERLOCK: You’re insane. 
JIM: You’re just getting that now? Okay, let me give you a little extra incentive. Your friends will die if you don’t. 
SHERLOCK: John. 
JIM: Not just John. Everyone. 
SHERLOCK: Mrs Hudson. 
JIM: Everyone. 
SHERLOCK: Lestrade. 
JIM: Three bullets; three gunmen; three victims. There’s no stopping them now. Unless my people see you jump. You can have me arrested; you can torture me; you can do anything you like with me; but nothing’s gonna prevent them from pulling the trigger. Your only three friends in the world will die ... unless ... 
SHERLOCK: ... unless I kill myself – complete your story. 
JIM: You’ve gotta admit that’s sexier. 
SHERLOCK: And I die in disgrace. 
JIM: Of course. That’s the point of this. Oh, you’ve got an audience now. Off you pop. Go on. I told you how this ends. Your death is the only thing that’s gonna call off the killers. I’m certainly not gonna do it. 
SHERLOCK: Would you give me ... one moment, please; one moment of privacy? Please? 
JIM: Of course. What? What is it? What did I miss? 
SHERLOCK: “You’re not going to do it.” So the killers can be called off, then – there’s a recall code or a word or a number. I don’t have to die ... if I’ve got you. 
JIM: Oh! You think you can make me stop the order? You think you can make me do that? 
SHERLOCK: Yes. So do you. 
JIM: Sherlock, your big brother and all the King’s horses couldn’t make me do a thing I didn’t want to. 
SHERLOCK: Yes, but I’m not my brother, remember? I am you – prepared to do anything; prepared to burn; prepared to do what ordinary people won’t do. You want me to shake hands with you in hell? I shall not disappoint you. 
JIM: Naah. You talk big. Naah. You’re ordinary. You’re ordinary – you’re on the side of the angels. 
SHERLOCK: Oh, I may be on the side of the angels, but don’t think for one second that I am one of them. 
JIM: No, you’re not. I see. You’re not ordinary. No. You’re me. You’re me! Thank you! Sherlock Holmes. Thank you. Bless you. As long as I’m alive, you can save your friends; you’ve got a way out. Well, good luck with that. 
LESTRADE: Yes, sir, thank you. ’Bye. 
JOHN: Hello? 
SHERLOCK: John. 
JOHN: Hey, Sherlock, you okay? 
SHERLOCK: Turn around and walk back the way you came now. 
JOHN: No, I’m coming in. 
SHERLOCK: Just do as I ask. Please. 
JOHN: Where? 
SHERLOCK: Stop there. 
JOHN: Sherlock? 
SHERLOCK: Okay, look up. I’m on the rooftop. 
JOHN: Oh God. 
SHERLOCK: I ... I ... I can’t come down, so we’ll ... we’ll just have to do it like this. 
JOHN: What’s going on? 
SHERLOCK: An apology. It’s all true. 
JOHN: Wh-what? 
SHERLOCK: Everything they said about me. I invented Moriarty. 
JOHN: Why are you saying this? 
SHERLOCK: I’m a fake. 
JOHN: Sherlock ... 
SHERLOCK: The newspapers were right all along. I want you to tell Lestrade; I want you to tell Mrs Hudson, and Molly ... in fact, tell anyone who will listen to you that I created Moriarty for my own purposes. 
JOHN: Okay, shut up, Sherlock, shut up. The first time we met ... the first time we met, you knew all about my sister, right? 
SHERLOCK: Nobody could be that clever. 
JOHN: You could. 
SHERLOCK: I researched you. Before we met I discovered everything that I could to impress you. It’s a trick. Just a magic trick. 
JOHN: No. All right, stop it now. 
SHERLOCK: No, stay exactly where you are. Don’t move. 
JOHN: All right. 
SHERLOCK: Keep your eyes fixed on me. Please, will you do this for me? 
JOHN: Do what? 
SHERLOCK: This phone call – it’s, er ... it’s my note. It’s what people do, don’t they – leave a note? 
JOHN: Leave a note when? 
SHERLOCK: Goodbye, John. 
JOHN: No. Don’t. 
JOHN: No. SHERLOCK! Sher... Sherlock, Sherlock ... I’m a doctor, let me come through. Let me come through, please. No, he’s my friend. He’s my friend. Please. Please, let me just ... Nggh, Jesus, no. God, no. 

ELLA: There’s stuff that you wanted to say ... but didn’t say it. 
JOHN: Yeah. 
ELLA: Say it now. 
JOHN: No. Sorry. I can’t. 

MRS HUDSON: There’s all the stuff, all the science equipment. I left it all in boxes. I don’t know what needs doing. I thought I’d take it to a school. Would you ...? 
JOHN: I can’t go back to the flat again – not at the moment. I’m angry. 
MRS HUDSON: It’s okay, John. There’s nothing unusual in that. That’s the way he made everyone feel. All the marks on my table; and the noise – firing guns at half past one in the morning! 
JOHN: Yeah. 
MRS HUDSON: Bloody specimens in my fridge. Imagine – keeping bodies where there’s food! 
JOHN: Yes. 
MRS HUDSON: And the fighting! Drove me up the wall with all his carryings-on! 
JOHN: Yeah, listen: I-I’m not actually that angry, okay? 
MRS HUDSON: Okay. I’ll leave you alone to, erm ... you know. 
JOHN: Um ... mmm. You ... you told me once that you weren’t a hero. Umm ... there were times I didn’t even think you were human, but let me tell you this: you were the best man, and the most human ... human being that I’ve ever known and no-one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, and so ... There. I was so alone, and I owe you so much. Okay. No, please, there’s just one more thing, mate, one more thing: one more miracle, Sherlock, for me. Don’t ... be ... dead. Would you do ...? Just for me, just stop it. Stop this.
